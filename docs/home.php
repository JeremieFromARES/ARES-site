                ARES is a language that aims to be excessively simple while still being crazy fast. A hard mountain to climb, i know.

                Or is it ?
                <br><br>
                The way ARES currently works is that it acts as an interface between the user and C++, which in theory could give the user a better experience coding while still be able to obtain an executable program with performances similar to native C++.

                IMPORTANT: THIS PROJECT IS STILL EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT AND CERTAIN EXPECTED FEATURES MIGHT BE MISSING
